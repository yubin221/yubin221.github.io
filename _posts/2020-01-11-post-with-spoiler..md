롤랜드 수소 리히터 감독의 수수께끼 같은 심리 스릴러(비디오/DVD로 직접 제작)는 시나리오 작가 마이클 쿠니의 희곡 "Point of Death"에 기반을 두고 있다.

야곱의 사다리(1990), 영혼의 생존자(2001), 나비효과(2004)와 같은 많은 유사한 영화에서처럼, 주인공이 죽음의 순간에 있었기 때문에 사건과 사람들은 철저히 왜곡되고 혼란스러웠다. 태그라인은 오해의 소지가 있습니다.

**"When You Don't Have a Memory, How Can You Remember Who to Trust?"**

The mind-warping film opened with a hospital patient Simon Cable (Ryan Phillippe) awakening in a <span class="spoiler"> hospital with little knowledge (amnesia perhaps?) of what had happened, and why he was there, etc. He was told by attending Dr. Jeremy Newman (Stephen Rea) that it was July 29, 2002 (Simon thought it was the year 2000 - he was confused - he heard a doctor say 20:00 hours!) and that he had died for two minutes from cardiac arrest following the near-fatal accident -- but he had been revived ("You're as good as new").</span> Dr. Newman: "Simon, this is the 29th of July. The year is 2002. And your wife, whose name is Anna, is waiting outside." 

#### What critiques say?

> "There's almost no single moment in Portrait of a Lady on Fire that couldn't be captured, mounted, and hung on a wall as high art." <cite>— Entertainment Weekly</cite>

A major clue to everything that truly happened was the scene that played next under the credits - hospital staff failed to bring a patient back to life with a defibrillator after a car accident. Chest compressions failed and there was no pulse. A second major clue was provided by hospital orderly Travis (Stephen Graham): Everybody dies. No mystery there. But why and how everyone dies. Now, there's a mystery worth solving. Probably the biggest mystery there is.

#### So how do we add spoilers in this theme?
